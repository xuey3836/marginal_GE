Zhang S., Xue Y., Zhang Q.& Ma S. (2019) Identifying the gene and gene-environment interactions with marginal penalization (manuscript).

# Usage
-------
1. Sig: standard significance standard method, which is the benchmark and ranks interactions (and main effects) based on their p values;

2. mMCP: which applies the popular MCP penalization and identifies important interactions and main
effects as those with nonzero estimates

3. msgMCP: the proposed sgMCP penalization approach
